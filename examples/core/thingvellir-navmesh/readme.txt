thingvellir_navmesh_new_2023.nav is the new navmesh generated from mapbox
simple.nav is the old one that we were using in the simulation, and also for reprojecting trajectories collected during the summer study. So we should use this one if we want to compare the simulations done with the old approach with the one done through the framework.
